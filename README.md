This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router Dom v6 with route parameters. The problem arises when trying to pass parameters to components, resulting in incorrect component rendering.  The solution provided uses the useParams hook correctly to access route parameters.  The bug.js file contains the flawed implementation, while bugSolution.js offers the corrected code.
